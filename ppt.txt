SLIDE 41.Moment of Experience--“Moment of Experience” Video Reviews let users share short, real-time videos with GPS and timestamp verification—making feedback truly genuine, emotionally honest, and extremely hard to fake.3.AI Receipt Scanner with “Real Purchase” Validation**--**The AI-powered OCR scanner instantly reads receipts, extracts item details, and checks them against genuine purchase keywords (like dal fry, paneer butter masala, haircut, or facial). Generic items such as Pepsi or chips are flagged as insufficient proof, ensuring only real, context-based purchases can validate a review.**--**Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scan uploaded receipts.✅ Cross-check for real items:Home-cooked meals: “dal fry,” “paneer butter masala,” “roti”Beauty services: “haircut,” “facial,” “cleanup”NOT just: “Pepsi,” “chips,” “bottle of water”4.Better UX:-Replace static star ratings with multi-dimensional badges (e.g., food freshness, punctuality, safety) and allow interactive trust signals for a richer, more accurate review experience.-Add “Verified by Owner” badge for transparency.Mandatory Timestamped Media Evidence (Photo/Video)📸 Require customers to submit geo-tagged and timestamped images from the location (food dish on table, selfie with mirror in salon).✅ Match timestamp with the receipt time (within 30 mins or 1 hour).📍 Location data (GPS) must match venue (or approximate vicinity).Makes it very hard for business owner to fake experience — unless they physically create that proof.-Owner verifies only receipt – a simple “proof of visit.” Review content goes through separate verification engine (AI + moderators). Once verified, it gets published. Owner sees full review only after publication.---🔄 Workflow Summary:Customer submits review, but before it’s eligible to be posted, they must attach:Photo of receipt (proof of transaction) Timestamped photo/video from visit (optional or required) Review content and rating (private at this stage) Review stays pending until business owner reviews only the evidence: They cannot see the rating or text — only the receipt & visual proof. If they confirm it’s a legit customer, they approve. Once approved, the full review (including rating & comments) goes live — and now the business owner can view it fully. If the owner doesn’t respond within X hours/days → review auto-publishes to prevent abuse.SLIDE 5-Step 1 — Customer Experience + Initial CaptureCustomer visits the shop, orders food/services, receives the printed bill, and captures on-location photos/videos.The system instantly scans the uploaded receipt using OCR and extracts items, prices, and timestamps.Step 2 — Real-Purchase ValidationThe system checks extracted items against genuine purchase keywords (meals, services, etc.).Generic or irrelevant items (like Pepsi, chips, water bottle) are flagged as insufficient proof.Step 3 — Time & Location Cross-CheckGPS data from photos/videos is matched with the receipt timestamp to confirm the user was physically present at the business.Step 4 — Owner Transparency Check + Final ApprovalBusiness owner sees the review content without user identity, preventing self-made fake positive reviews.If all checks pass, the review becomes:✔ Verified Purchase✔ Authentic Experience✔ Safe From ManipulationIf any layer fails → review is held or rejected.---SLIDE 6**Food Delivery**2025: 35% fake reviews2035 WITH Trustify: 10%2035 WITHOUT Trustify: 55%**Restaurant Reviews**2025: 45%2035 WITH Trustify: 12%2035 WITHOUT Trustify: 65%**Local Services**2025: 55%2035 WITH Trustify: 15%2035 WITHOUT Trustify: 70%**Travel Stays**2025: 30%2035 WITH Trustify: 8%2035 WITHOUT Trustify: 45%**E-Commerce**2025: 40%2035 WITH Trustify: 10%2035 WITHOUT Trustify: 60%HEADINGProjected Reduction in Fake Reviews by 2035 With VariFax
